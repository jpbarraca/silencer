Experimental encrypted PushBullet (Android/Chrome Extension only) using AES-GCM and WebCrypto.

# Setup
## Chrome Extension
Download the Chrome extension and drag it onto the [Chrome extensions](chrome://extensions/) window (developer mode may need to be enabled). Alternatively, patch the existing PushBullet files (located in the Chrome extension folder). Next, open PushBullet options from the toolbar and enter a password in the encryption key field under the newly added encryption tab. This can be anything, but must also be entered on the Android application.

###Chrome Extension Issue
Chrome may try to disable this extension. If this becomes an issue, let me know, and I'll try to put it on the Chrome Web Store. Here is a workaround:
```
Download the crx file and unpack the extension using your favorite decompresser. Take note of the directory where you placed it.
Open the extension page, activate "Developer Mode"
Click "Load unpacked extension..."
Search trough your directory tree for the directory where you unpacked your extension and click OK. If your extension is called "my extension" then select "my extension" directory.
```

## Android Application
Download the signed APK or compile one from source, then follow the setup instructions on your device.

## Verifying Setup
Once the above steps are completed, setup can be verified by sending a notification to your device. You can use the TEST button. It will be mirrored to Chrome and appear exactly the same as it would without Silencer, including dismiss support. On the Chrome extensions page with developer mode enabled, click the "Inspect views" button under PushBullet. In the window that appears, click console. In the console, there will be messages that begin with "Encrypted" followed by an encrypted string. This string contains notification data that would normally be sent in plain text.

#Notes
Responding to notifications and enabling/disabling specific apps is NOT YET SUPPORTED. Icons and images are NOT YET ENCRYPTED.

This is *very* experimental and may not work as intended, or at all. It was created solely as a challenge, but has been released because of demand. It was put together quickly, so expect some bugs.

To the PushBullet team: if you want this removed, let me know.
